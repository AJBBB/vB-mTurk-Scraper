Simply run ```python vB-mTurk-Scraper.py``` and it will guide you through setting the forum you want to scrape, entering todays thread number, which page you want to start from, and how many pages you want to go through.\r\n\r\nNote: When entering the address to the forum, enter only the domain, ex: <strong>forum.com</strong>\r\n\r\nIt outputs all HITs to HITs/<strong>mturklinks-todaysdate.html</strong> by default.\r\n \r\nThe final question asked is about writing to the HITs/<strong>forumlog-todaysdate.txt</strong> file. If you answer with True it will write to HITs/forumlog-todaysdate.txt file with just the links so you can share that plain text with people.\r\n\r\nThis is perfect for when you wake up! Run it on the HITs thread of any <strong>vBulletin</strong> mTurk forum you like, and you get an html file full of all the HITs you missed. (Note: There will be NO duplicates as of <strong>v1.5</strong>)\r\n\r\nThis has only been tested on Mturkforum.com and Turkernation.com - Any vBulletin forum that allows you to read posts without being logged in should work.\r\n\r\n<strong>NOTE:</strong> When setting the number of pages to use, please make sure you are displaying 40 posts per page when checking the site\r\n***\r\nWindows Users\r\n\r\nClick \"Download ZIP\" on the right side of the page. Extract the Windows-Version-1.5 folder and run ```vB-mTurk-Scraper.exe```\r\n\r\n***\r\nMIT Licensed\r\n",
